Java FX High Low Game
=========
## CS211 Group Project 

This is a simple JavaFX app that plays the game High Low:

The App will randomly pick a number from 1 to 100. 
The user will submit a guess and the app will either respond Higher Or Lower depending on the target number vs user guess.

This is for a group homework for CS211 Advance Java
